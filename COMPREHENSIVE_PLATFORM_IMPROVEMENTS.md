PUT    /api/lab-tests/{id}      // Update lab test
DELETE /api/lab-tests/{id}      // Delete lab test

GET    /api/imaging-tests       // Get all imaging tests
POST   /api/imaging-tests       // Create new imaging test
PUT    /api/imaging-tests/{id}  // Update imaging test
DELETE /api/imaging-tests/{id}  // Delete imaging test

// Test Ordering
POST   /api/test-orders         // Submit test orders
GET    /api/patients            // Get patient list
```
