## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Migrations
Successfully executed 4 new migrations:
1. `create_notifications_table` - Notification system foundation
2. `create_suppliers_table` - Supplier management database
3. `create_work_orders_table` - Work order tracking system
4. `create_supplier_assignments_table` - Role-based supplier assignments

### Model Relationships
- **User → Notifications**: One-to-many for receiving notifications
- **Supplier → WorkOrders**: One-to-many for supplier work orders
- **User → WorkOrders**: One-to-many for created work orders
- **SupplierAssignment**: Pivot table with additional metadata

### Security Considerations
- Role-based access control throughout all new features
- Input validation for all form submissions
- File upload security with type and size restrictions
- CSRF protection on all state-changing operations

## User Experience Improvements
