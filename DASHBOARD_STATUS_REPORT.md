# FHIR-DICOM Healthcare Platform - Profile Dashboard Status Report

## ✅ **RESOLVED ISSUES**

### 1. **Patient Name Encryption Problem** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue**: Patient names appeared as encrypted codes in management interface
- **Solution**: Enhanced `Patient.php` model with proper `JsonSerializable` interface and encryption/decryption methods
- **Status**: All patient names now display correctly as readable text

### 2. **Server Port Conflicts** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue**: Laravel server conflicted with AI models on port 8000
- **Solution**: 
  - Laravel backend: `http://localhost:8090`
  - MedGemma AI server: `http://localhost:8000`
  - Ollama models: `http://localhost:11434`
- **Status**: All services running on separate ports without conflicts

### 3. **Lab Technician Profile Navigation** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue**: Lab tech profile showed generic dashboard with irrelevant tabs (Patients, AI Analysis, etc.)
- **Solution**: Created dedicated `layouts/lab.blade.php` with lab-specific navigation:
  - Dashboard (overview)
  - Sampling & Results
  - Lab Financials
  - Configuration
- **Status**: Lab technicians now see focused, job-relevant interface

### 4. **Doctor Profile Dashboard Missing** - FIXED ✅
- **Issue**: Doctor dashboard redirected to patient management, making Dashboard and Patients tabs show identical content
- **Solution**: 
  - Created new `doctor-dashboard.blade.php` with medical overview
  - Updated routing logic to show proper doctor dashboard
  - Clear distinction between Dashboard (overview) and Patients (management)
- **Status**: Doctors now have dedicated dashboard with statistics, quick actions, and activity overview
