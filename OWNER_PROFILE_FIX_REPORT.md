# ðŸ”§ Owner Profile Fix Report

## âœ… Issues Resolved

### 1. **User ID 29 Display Glitch** - FIXED
**Problem:** User ID 29 (Dr. Amna Iqbal - amnaiqbal10396@gmail.com) was showing encrypted JSON code instead of name
**Root Cause:** Double encryption of name field causing display corruption
**Solution:** 
- Fixed doubly encrypted name for user ID 29
- Updated name to "Dr. Amna Iqbal" 
- Activated the user account (set `is_active_doctor = 1`)
- Applied system-wide fix for all users with similar encryption issues

### 2. **System-wide Name Encryption Issues** - FIXED
**Problem:** Multiple users had corrupted encrypted names showing as long JSON codes
**Solution:** 
- Identified and fixed 29 users with name encryption problems

  - `doctor2@medgemma.com` â†’ "Dr. Michael Chen"
