# User Deletion and Revenue Sharing Fix Report

## Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ User Deletion Issues Fixed

**Problem**: Users with IDs 4, 5, and 6 couldn't be deleted from the owner portal due to foreign key constraints.

**Root Cause**: Users had related records in the following tables:
- User ID 4 (Lab Tech): 1 salary record
- User ID 5 (Dr. James Wilson): 1 salary record  
- User ID 6 (Admin User): 2 expense records

**Solution**: Enhanced the deletion route to handle cascading deletes properly:
```php
// Delete user with proper cascade handling
if ($user->salaries()->count() > 0) {
    $user->salaries()->delete();
}

if ($user->expenses()->count() > 0) {
    $user->expenses()->delete();
}

if ($user->doctorEarnings()->count() > 0) {
    $user->doctorEarnings()->delete();
}

// Prevent deletion if user has invoices (important business data)
if ($user->invoices()->count() > 0) {
    return response()->json([
        'error' => 'Cannot delete user with existing invoices. Please reassign invoices first.'
    ], 400);
}
```

### 2. ✅ Owner Dashboard Revenue Sharing Corrected

**Problem**: Owner dashboard showed 30% share for Laboratory, Radiology, and Pharmacy revenue, but owner should get 100%.

**Solution**: Updated owner dashboard to show correct revenue sharing:
- **Consultation**: 30% owner share (doctors get 70%)
- **Laboratory**: 100% owner share (doctors get optional percentage from referrals)
- **Radiology**: 100% owner share (doctors get optional percentage from referrals)  
- **Pharmacy**: 100% owner share (doctors get optional percentage from prescriptions)

### 3. ✅ Doctor Revenue Sharing System Implemented

**New Feature**: Added comprehensive revenue sharing system for ancillary services.

**Database Changes**:
- Added new fields to `users` table:
  - `lab_revenue_percentage` - Doctor's % from lab orders they generate
  - `radiology_revenue_percentage` - Doctor's % from imaging orders they generate
  - `pharmacy_revenue_percentage` - Doctor's % from prescriptions they write

- Created new `doctor_ancillary_earnings` table to track:
  - Doctor ID and service details
  - Service amount and doctor percentage
  - Calculated doctor earnings
  - Service date and metadata

**User Interface Enhancements**:
- Added revenue sharing fields to both user creation and editing forms
- Clear labels and help text explaining each field
- Validation for 0-100% ranges with decimal precision

## How the New Revenue Sharing Works

### For Owner:
- **Consultations**: Gets 30% of consultation fees
- **Lab/Radiology/Pharmacy**: Gets 100% minus any doctor referral percentages

### For Doctors:
- **Consultation Revenue**: Gets percentage set in `revenue_share` field (default 70%)
- **Lab Referral Revenue**: Gets percentage set in `lab_revenue_percentage` field from tests they order
- **Radiology Referral Revenue**: Gets percentage set in `radiology_revenue_percentage` field from imaging they order  
- **Pharmacy Referral Revenue**: Gets percentage set in `pharmacy_revenue_percentage` field from prescriptions they write

### Example Scenario:
Dr. Smith has these settings:
- Consultation revenue share: 70%
- Lab referral share: 5%
- Radiology referral share: 3% 
- Pharmacy referral share: 2%

If Dr. Smith:
- Does a $100 consultation → Gets $70, Owner gets $30
- Orders a $200 lab test → Gets $10 (5%), Owner gets $190
- Orders a $500 MRI → Gets $15 (3%), Owner gets $485
- Prescribes $50 medication → Gets $1 (2%), Owner gets $49

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Added to users table
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN lab_revenue_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN radiology_revenue_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NULL;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN pharmacy_revenue_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NULL;

-- New table for tracking earnings
CREATE TABLE doctor_ancillary_earnings (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    doctor_id BIGINT NOT NULL,
    service_type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    service_id VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    service_amount DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    doctor_percentage DECIMAL(5,2) NOT NULL,
    doctor_earning DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL,
    patient_name VARCHAR(255) NULL,
    service_date DATE NOT NULL,
    metadata JSON NULL
);
```

### Model Relationships:
```php
// User model
public function doctorAncillaryEarnings() {
    return $this->hasMany(DoctorAncillaryEarning::class, 'doctor_id');
}

// DoctorAncillaryEarning model  
public function doctor() {
    return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'doctor_id');
}
```

## Testing Results

### User Deletion Test:
- ✅ User ID 4 (Lab Tech): Can now be deleted (salary records cascaded)
- ✅ User ID 5 (Dr. James Wilson): Can now be deleted (salary records cascaded)
- ✅ User ID 6 (Admin User): Can now be deleted (expense records cascaded)

### Revenue Sharing Test:
- ✅ Owner dashboard now shows correct percentages (100% for lab/radiology/pharmacy)
- ✅ User creation form includes all revenue sharing fields
- ✅ User editing form includes all revenue sharing fields with proper validation
- ✅ Database fields accept decimal percentages (e.g., 5.25%)

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Automatic Calculation Service**: Create service to automatically calculate doctor earnings when:
   - Lab orders are processed
   - Radiology studies are completed  
   - Prescriptions are dispensed

2. **Reporting Dashboard**: Add doctor-specific earnings reports showing breakdown by service type

3. **Payment Integration**: Connect to payroll system for automatic doctor payments

4. **Revenue Analytics**: Enhanced analytics showing revenue splits across all services
